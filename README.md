# Human_pose_estimation_project
This project implements human pose estimation using the skeleton method, leveraging deep learning and computer vision techniques to detect keypoints (joints) in human bodies from images.<br>
The system outputs skeletal structures by connecting the detected keypoints, enabling applications in fields like sports analytics, healthcare, augmented reality (AR), and surveillance.
